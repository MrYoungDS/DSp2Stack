/**
 * An interface for a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack structure,
 * similar to the <code>java.util.Stack</code> class.
 * <p></p>
 * The data in the stack will be stored in <code>Node</code> objects,
 * with each node storing a data element of type <code>T</code>,
 * and a reference to the next node. For this project, a <code>Node</code>
 * class has been provided, but you can choose to modify this project structure.
 * <p></p>
 * The goal of this project is to implement this interface, so you may not
 * use Java library stack implementations, such as <code>java.util.Vector</code>,
 * <code>java.util.Deque</code> implementations, or the Java Collections Framework.
 * <p></p>
 * This short project is similar to the linked list implementation that you built
 * for the previous project, with <code>push</code> replacing <code>addFirst</code>,
 * and <code>pop</code> replacing <code>delete</code> with index 0.
 * You will be expected to check for null pointer and out of bounds exceptions.
